Lets Renovate is an online platform that focused on psychology and home decoration and explores how our living environments influence mental well-being and behavior. It provides expert advice on creating spaces that promote relaxation, productivity, and emotional balance. By combining design principles with psychological insights, the website helps users curate their homes to align with their emotional needs, offering tips on color psychology, lighting, layout, and decor choices that enhance mood and cognitive function. The project is part of the Code Institute's Full-Stack Developer course and focuses on Django framework, database manipulation, and CRUD functionality.

# Overview
Lets Renovate is a fictitious business that started out as a blog and it focuses on latest insights in color psychology with expert design techniques to transform users home into a sanctuary that aligns with their personal style and psychological needs. This is a full stack website built using the Django web framework, with the aim of converting blog readers into home designers. This website provides the user with; a blog, comments sections, an about page to read about the business owner and the business itself, a form for users that are not registered to make collaboration requests, and an app for registered website users to make bookings for a consultancy after selecting design and style from inspiration page that provides different designs for different sections of home.

The platform ensures accessibility across all devices and browsers, and its goal is to streamline the process of finding and scheduling consultations. In future iterations, LetsRenovate will add functionality for home designers providers to manage their schedules, send reminders to patients, and offer tools for patient-doctor communication.
